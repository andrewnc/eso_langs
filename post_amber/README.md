# ddtest

The Application or The Library doing The Thing.

## Use Ddtest library in your project

**DELETE THIS PARAGRAPH, IF Ddtest IS A LIBRARY. DELETE WHOLE THIS SECTION IF Ddtest IS AN APP, NOT A LIBRARY.**

If not already done, install Amber and create an Amber project with `amber init`,
as shown in [Amber Instructions](https://lolg.it/amber/amber#prerequisities).

In a project, run

```sh
npm install Ddtest --save
grunt devel
amber serve
```

Go to `http://localhost:4000/` in your browser and
in all packages that use Ddtest,
add `'amber-ddtest/Ddtest'` to the package imports,
save the change and commit the package. Reload.
